Back when I would hang out with my old pal Jtax we had a bad habit of driving down to 4th street, drinking too much Shiraz, and then driving back home. One good takeaway from all this was discovering that my favorite Shiraz wines were often blended with Grenache and as such I ended up drinking too much Grenache (but mostly at home).

I haven't had a Grenache in years. Years. Never had a WineSmith but I like AleSmith beers so you put Smith in the name and you got me.

Pop and pour (and some good 60 seconds of swirling) and the nose has some non-descript fullness with no alcohol, which is cool 'cause I thought it might at 14%. Slightly tart, I'd say about 80% of too much. Tartness fades quickly and doesn't quite make we want to salivate, maybe a tad. Body is right there in the middle of medium. Getting some of that tannic dryness on my tongue; not enough to put me off but close.

I get some wonderful ripe strawberry on the nose and on my palate. Jammy with that nice acid level to balance it out (was almost too much but the long swirling mellowed that out).

(time has elapsed. as it does.)

Ok yes this is much better now. All the good stuff from above but just smoother and brighter. Will pop another bottle and go again! I can't fit 10+ of these in my cellar if I keep everything else I wanna cellar.
