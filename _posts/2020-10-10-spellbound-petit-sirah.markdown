Bottle arrived on Thursday (good timing, we're getting a hot spell in Texas this weekend) and let it sit until Saturday evening. My tasting partner and I eat kinda late on Saturdays so we opted to go ahead and do the tasting unaccompanied.

The color was a nice clean dark ruby which coats the glass. It seemed hot on the nose at first pour so I took a minute to give it some good swirling. My co-sampler was able to pick up fruity aromas a few feet away from me. I mentioned I got cranberry and kind of regret saying that out loud, because once I did that was the only flavor the other rat could pick out.

Jammy at first and quickly fades. Nice tannins but didn't suck all the moisture out of my mouth. Medium body. It's confusing because the body seems to start thick and then quickly loosens up.

Opened up nicely after several minutes and warming up in the glass. It's certainly not a sweet wine. Body is very smooth.

No burn. Nice acidity to go along with the tannin characteristics.

Very quick short finished. SUPER FAST. Clean.

Would have been nice to try this with a steak.

Not getting a lot of layers. Not very complex. This is an inoffensive petit sirah. It's got one note and it hits it AOK. Nothing wrong with this guy and nothing outstanding either. If I were a guest at a wedding reception or a eating at a steakhouse and wanted an inexpensive glass of wine I would be perfectly happy with it.

Saving the 2nd half of the bottle for the next day.
