I probably made a mistake opening this bottle of wine while smoking a cigar. Eh
maybe it'd be OK if I were smoking something lighter bodied but this Padron 3000
Maduro can be overwhelming.

**BAH** *On commence!*

Light clean mouthfeel. Not tannic/overly dry. Strawberry (and maybe not-quite-so-sour cranberry)
fruit but not sweet not jammy. No weird dog hair wang aftertaste which I dread and often get
from your run of the mill grocery store wines - so nice there's nunna that there!

Acidity level medium-low, complements what I wrote above.

Not a complex/rich wine by any stretch and one that's been well received by
anybody we've shared it with. Starts nice and finishes nice. Very enjoyable.
Just a really clean, classy and well done fun drinker.
