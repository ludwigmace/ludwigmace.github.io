Is that a minerally nose? A little peppery? No alcohol, nice.

Bordering on a lighter body. High side of light, very low side of medium body.

Mouthfeel has a tiny bit of tannin pucker and it fits. A tad bit of heat. Neither are overpowering or souring. Getting some pepper on the palate. Some plumminess on the backend. Certainly not a sweet wine.
