We've been having quite a few things delivered these past months. Not because we're
scared of going places, we just wanna make the house look nicer and man it's just
easier for D to shop online.

With all the shit we've been getting we've also been accruing SO MUCH CARDBOARD. It's
kind of a Zen practice for me, breaking down the cardboard into little bite-size pieces,
binding them together for the fine members of the city's trash team[^1] to manually
toss into the big blue recycling truck[^2].

[^1]: Austin Resource Recovery is the name of the trash team. Should I consider that a euphemism? That's what imagonnado.
[^2]: It's probably not blue. But blue means recycling so that's the picture my kid imagination spins up.
