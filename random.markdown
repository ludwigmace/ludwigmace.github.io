Just some random thoughts here.

Nobody should want unchecked power. You shouldn't want unchecked power at your work or in your home. It's healthy to make sure that other people can be backstops to thwart your bad decisions. If someone in power actively makes attempts to remove checks on their power - either by removing positions or replacing folks in those positions with yesmen - then be very wary of this person in power.

Define a subset of people with a characteristic of being able to feel pride or shame about a particular subject, but not both. No room for nuance. It's very difficult for them to look back on their personal history (or what they feel is their personal lineage/history) and simultaneously - for example - be proud of all that the US has accomplished and recognize publicly (or front of mind) that it was wrong to displace and kill Native Americans, it was wrong to intern Japanese Americans, it was wrong to enslave people, etc.
